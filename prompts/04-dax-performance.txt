@powerbi Analyse measure [Total Revenue].

1. Generate a DAX query that evaluates it across the highest cardinality dimensions.
2. Run it using RunDAXQueryWithMetrics.
3. Return timing information, storage engine vs formula engine breakdown.
4. Suggest an optimized version if the measure uses:
   - row-by-row iterators
   - unnecessary CALCULATE
   - complex filters
   - non-delegable logic

5. Replace the measure only after I approve.

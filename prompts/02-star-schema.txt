@powerbi I want to create a proper star schema.

1. From the Sales table, extract distinct lists into:
   - DimCustomer
   - DimProduct
   - DimDate (based on the SalesDate column)

2. Add surrogate keys for each dimension.
3. Build a Fact_Sales table with only numeric and foreign key columns.
4. Create relationships:
   - Fact_Sales → DimCustomer
   - Fact_Sales → DimProduct
   - Fact_Sales → DimDate

5. Mark DimDate as a date table.
6. Auto-hide all key columns from report view.
7. Show me the model diagram after changes.
